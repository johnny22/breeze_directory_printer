This script will use the breezechms api to download your member information and then creates a html document ready for printing. Two things will need to be done before running. First, rename connect_template.py to connect.py and enter your breeze url and api. Second, if you want images, create a folder called Final_images and put your images in it with the last name of the person in the photo. If you have multiple people with the same last name, use the format lastname firstname.
