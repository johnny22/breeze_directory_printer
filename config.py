#This option is uesful if you want to edit the template file. Run the script once with
# READ_FROM_DISK set to False. This will make all the necessary calls to breeze and
# save the necessary infomation. Then change READ_FROM_DISK  to True. Now you can edit
# the template files and run the script again to check. The script will read the
# informatin from disk, so it should be near instantaneous.

# These options will let you choose where your pictures are coming from so that
# the script can put the right names in the html. If you choose USE_IMAGE_FOLDER,
# you will need to have a folder called Final_images that contains your pictures. This
# is a good option if you want to have higher quality images than breeze supports.
# If you choose USE_BREEZE_PICTURE, then you can just download your pictures from breeze,
# put them in a folder in this directory, and change the path setting here.
