handle errors connecting to breeze resulting from timeout if connection works. Should be able to just remake the call

Set up dropbox api and point there for photos, or figure out a way to do it on our website

landing page with options to view images or directory or make new directory
options page
run page


Is there a way to check if any photos have been added since last resize, and only resize new photos? Check create time?

Double check breeze api, make sure I can't do it all in one call

Create simple gui with check box for run from disk or get new info from breeze and status output
Any other options I need?

Will I try to package it, or have the user use pipenv? Or what about running it on the website
